## Results on Human3.6M
Here, we compare our IGANet with recent state-of-the-art methods on Human3.6M dataset. The 2D pose detected by cascaded pyramid network (CPN) is used as input.
We use $\S$ to highlight methods that use additional refinement module.
Evaluation metric is Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE) in mmâ€‹.

|   Models    |  MPJPE   |
| :---------: | :------: |
| GraFormer   |  51.8 mm  |
| MGCN $\S$      |  49.4 mm  |
|  IGANet     | **48.3** mm |


## Dependencies

- Cudatoolkit: 10.2
- Python: 3.7.11
- Pytorch: 1.10.0 

Create conda environment:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Dataset setup

### Setup from original source 
You can obtain the Human3.6M dataset from the [Human3.6M](http://vision.imar.ro/human3.6m/) website, and then set it up using the instructions provided in [VideoPose3D](https://github.com/facebookresearch/VideoPose3D). 

### Setup from preprocessed dataset
 You also can access the processed data by downloading it from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/112GPdRC9IEcwcJRyrLJeYw9_YV4wLdKC?usp=sharing).

```bash
${POSE_ROOT}/
|-- dataset
|   |-- data_3d_h36m.npz
|   |-- data_2d_h36m_gt.npz
|   |-- data_2d_h36m_cpn_ft_h36m_dbb.npz
```

## Test the pre-trained model
Pre-trained model can be found [here](). please download it and put id in the './pre_trained_model' dictory.


To Test the pre-trained model on Human3.6M:
```bash
python main.py --test --reload --previous_dir "./pre_trained_model" --model model_IGANet --layers 3 --nepoch 20 --gpu 0
```

## Train the model from scratch

For Human3.6M:

```bash
python main.py --train --model model_IGANet --layers 3 --nepoch 20 --gpu 0
```

## Demo

The visualization code will be released soon.
